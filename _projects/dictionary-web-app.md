excerpt: "The client for this application approached me because they were looking to create a product that allows drivers to quickly connect with mechanics when dealing with car problems. They also were loooking to enable hobbyist and mechanics unassociated with any particular shop the opportunity to gig-work and manage their own time. I was able to effectively create user personas, competitive audits, sketches, wireframes and a final prototype and send over final assets to an engineer in around three months."

Project Case Study: Dictionary Text Audio Web App

## Overview

In this project, I built a real-world dictionary web app using the Dictionary API. The app allows users to search for words using an input field, view the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word, play the audio file for a word when available, switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts, and switch between light and dark themes. The project also aims to provide a seamless user experience across different screen sizes and devices.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code as the code editor
- Sass for CSS pre-processing
- Gulp for automating tasks, such as compiling Sass and optimizing images
- Git and GitHub for version control and project management

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced was integrating the Dictionary API and retrieving data for the searched words. The API provided a lot of data, and I had to figure out how to display the data in a user-friendly way while also ensuring that the app was accessible and responsive. I also had to implement audio playback functionality for words that had audio files available. Another challenge was implementing the theme and font switcher functionality while ensuring that the app's design remained consistent and visually appealing.

## Approach

I began by setting up the project's file structure and creating the HTML markup. I used the pre-written content provided and added my own HTML elements to structure the content and create a layout that was responsive and accessible. Next, I used Sass to create the app's styles and implemented the theme and font switcher functionality. I also created hover and focus states for interactive elements to improve the app's user experience.

To integrate the Dictionary API, I used JavaScript to handle the API request and retrieve the data for the searched word. I then created a function to display the data in a formatted way on the app's interface. I also implemented audio playback functionality using the HTML5 audio element.

To optimize the app's performance, I used Gulp to automate tasks such as compiling Sass, optimizing images, and minifying CSS and JavaScript files. I also used Git and GitHub for version control and project management.

## Results

The final result was a real-world dictionary web app that integrated the Dictionary API and provided a user-friendly interface for searching and viewing word definitions. The app's theme and
