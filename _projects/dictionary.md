title: "Dictionary Text Audio Web App"
excerpt: "The client for this application approached me because they were looking to create a product that allows drivers to quickly connect with mechanics when dealing with car problems. They also were loooking to enable hobbyist and mechanics unassociated with any particular shop the opportunity to gig-work and manage their own time. I was able to effectively create user personas, competitive audits, sketches, wireframes and a final prototype and send over final assets to an engineer in around three months."

Integrated Dictionary API to create a real-world dictionary web app.
It also includes colour themes and font selection.

## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this dictionary web app using the Dictionary API and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

## Goals

- [x] Search for words using the input field
- [x] See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- [x] See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- [x] Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- [x] Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- [x] Switch between light and dark themes
- [x] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [ ] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- [ ] Bonus: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. Hint: Research prefers-color-scheme in CSS.

## Assets provided

- Sketch and Figma design files
- Mobile, tablet & desktop layouts
- Professional design system for colors, fonts, etc.
- Optimized image assets
- README file to help you get started
- HTML file with pre-written content

## Ideas to test yourself

- Write your styles using a pre-processor, such as Sass, Less or Stylus
- Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
- Use a JavaScript framework/library to practice templating and/or building using components
- Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is important for professional developers
